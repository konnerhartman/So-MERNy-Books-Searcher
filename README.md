# So MERNy Books Searcher
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)    

  ## Description
  With this application, I took starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

  This refactoring job is not yet complete.
